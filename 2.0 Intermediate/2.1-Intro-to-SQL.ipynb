    "Before we dive into the specifics of SQL, let's quickly discuss the basics of databases and relational databases in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **database**: a database is a collection of data about entities. It can be more or less structured, depending on the type of database, and can include information about the relationships between entities.\n",
    "- **database management system (DBMS)**: DBMS is a system that provides infrastructure for storing, managing and interacting with databases. It generally includes 3 elements: how to store data, a query language, support for transactions and crash recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, in a **_relational database management system (RDBMS)_**, or relational database, data records are stored in **_tables_**, each of which:\n",
    "\n",
    "- has a predefined set of **_columns_** - the pieces of information captured for each record in a table.\n",
    "- stores data records as **_rows_** in the table, where each row has a place to store a value for every column in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables, including their columns, column types and relationships with other tables, are defined in a database **_schema_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When tables contain a **_primary key_**, one or more columns that uniquely identify each row in a given table, rows in one table can also be explicitly related to rows in other tables through **_foreign key_** columns that hold the primary key of the related row.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this class is stored using the Postgresql RDBMS."

    "SQL is a quirky language, designed for a very specific purpose: to interact with relational data. It isn't structured like other languages, and while it can make data access easy, it also can make tasks that would be easy in other languages (though perhaps not exceptionally performant) confoundingly complex.  Let's dive in so you can see it for yourself!\n",

    "## `SELECT` - Querying the database\n",
    "\n",
    "- Back to the [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic method of querying the database is to use a select statement. To retrievel all columns and rows in the hh_indcase_spells table, we can use the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM Colleges\n",
    "    LIMIT 1000;\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Columns_ or _variables_ that would like returned are put in the **SELECT clause** (after the word \"SELECT\" but before the word \"FROM\").  An asterisk ( \"\\*\" ) is a wildcard - it will return all columns for a given table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is considered good style to capitalize the parts of an SQL query that are part of the SQL language (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.), and not variables, table names, or values you are filtering on or searching for.\n",
    "- Although it isn't always necessary, you should end SQL statements with a semi-colon.  It isn't required everywhere, but it is required in some contexts so better to be aware and get into the habit.\n",
    "- white spaces and line breaks has no effect on the outcome of the query. It is recommended to use line breaks to improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LIMIT clause\n",
    "\n",
    "- Back to the [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to limit the number of _rows_ retrived during data exploration because as a database grows toward \"big data\", retrieving all rows in a table can take a long time, and storing them all in a program that lets you view the results can take a lot of memory. To retrieve the first 1000 rows of the `Colleges` table, a **LIMIT clause** is added to the end of a query:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM Colleges\n",

    "\n",
    "- Back to the [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times only certain _columns_ are needed for a specific task. Instead of specifying “all” columns using the \"\\*\" , you can specify which columns you want by name, in a comma-delimited list after \"SELECT\". Here we select the UNITID, institution name (INSTNM), count of non working-not enrolled alumni after 10 years (COUNT_NWNE_P10), count of working-not enrolled alumni after 10 years (COUNT_WNE_P10)  from the Colleges table.\n",

In SQL, this is particularly relevant since a single SQL query can become very complex very quickly, and you want to understand exactly what is going on if you are planning on using the query to `CREATE` or `UPDATE` the database.  It can be tempting to just write out a giant query all at once then test, but this is often much more difficult to debug if you have problems.

    "SQL Lets you join multiple tables together inside a single query by specifying JOIN criteria that tell the database when a row from one of the two tables can be considered a match for a row in the other.  Generally, you'll join on shared IDs (usually a ForeignKey in one table that references the ID of a row in the other), or on shared identifying information like SSN or name.\n",

In the first, if you have a lot of conditionals in your WHERE clause, the database might do a lot of work before it gets to this limiting JOIN clause that it could otherwise have avoided.  In the second, by telling the database exactly which conditional tests relate to joining, you create the potential for it to more efficiently plan your query (not always fulfilled, but...).\n",
